      text: "Electrical Engineering today is no longer limited to circuits and machines, it is increasingly data-driven. From power systems and smart grids to IoT sensors and fault diagnostics, massive amounts of data are generated continuously. Data analytics enables an electrical engineer to extract meaningful insights from this data, optimize system performance, predict failures, and support intelligent decision-making. Learning analytics bridges the gap between traditional engineering and modern industry requirements.",
